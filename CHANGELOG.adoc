=== Dependency update

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-emf-json/issues/60[#60] [releng] Update EMF dependencies.
The following dependencies have been updated:

* `org.eclipse.emf.common` from `2.21.0` to `2.31.0`
* `org.eclipse.emf.ecore` from `2.23.0` to `2.37.0`
* `org.eclipse.emf.ecore.xmi` from `2.16.0` to `2.38.0`

- Switched to Google Guava 33.4.8 (from 32.0.0).
Guava is only used by the test code, so this has no impact on the actual behavior.
- The dependency to `org.eclipse.emf.ecore.xmi` is now internal and limited to the tests.
